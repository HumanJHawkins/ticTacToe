DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS: Originally I thought to take advice from a student that the game would benefit from a check for
CATS game prior to the last cell being marked. I.e. if there are no potential winning moves, stop the game. However, the
Tic-tac-toe is a game where the determining factor in winning is awareness of such things. So, automatically ending the
game before players notice (and can choose to end it themselves) would remove part of the challenge in playing.

At a minimum, detection and handling of "CATS games should be a preference.
